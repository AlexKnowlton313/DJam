## Some explanations
It’s important to note that we wanted to emphasize this application
being for *live* streaming purposes, and not simply for listening
music and having the queue under your control.
For these reasons the following features apply:
- No song title in the live stream feed view
	- Obviously, it wouldn’t be difficult for us to add the 
	title of the song to the screen. We thought it would be
	unnecessary and would take away from the concept of
	live streaming. All the user needs to know is the user
	of the stream, its title, and the album cover (more for
	aesthetics purposes). Seeing the name of the song can
	prevent a user from tuning to the channel.
- Only 2 songs in the queue
	- Again, we didn’t want the streamer to queue many songs
	and leave their device. The point of the application is
	DJing, so we wanted the streamer to stay on top of their queue
	constantly (just like on real radio).
- No pause button
	- From the perspective of the streamer, the streamer doesn’t
	need to be able to pause the stream (just like on real radio).
	From the perspective of the user who’s tuning to a live stream,
	stopping a live stream is easy — by clicking the Back button
	from the Currently Playing view.

OTHERS:
- We wanted graders to pay attention to the fact that all album covers,
song titles, and artists update automatically, once the next song in the queue 
starts playing. We used Firebase for this feature.
- Only Premium Spotify accounts (their API only allows for Premium)
- Still some bugs present, will resubmitted backend code for the next deadline.
- Design was implemented for the tablet we had. We will try to make it more
device-universal for the next deadline.
